# React CRUD Project
## [DEMO](https://ignatsemchuk.github.io/crud-react/)

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
## How to use
1. ``` git clone https://github.com/IgnatSemchuk/crud-react.git```  
   or download `zip` package
2. In the project dir run `npm install`
3. Run script you need
 
## Available Scripts
1. ``` npm run start```  
  Runs the app in the development mode.
  Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
  The page will reload if you make edits.
  You will also see any lint errors in the console.
  
2. ```npm run build```  
   Builds the app for production to the build folder. 
   It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
   The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
   Your app is ready to be deployed!
   
3. ```npm run eject```  
   Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!  
   If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
